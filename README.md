## Working project name: Styl

Executive Summary of Service:
Our project will be a supervised learning classification problem, where we will recommend clothing styles that would enhance the online shopping experience for the user. Our current objective is to take a picture of an article of clothing that they own and recommend an outfit based on that picture. Our project would consist of multiple parts:

- Computer vision algorithm to read the picture of clothing the user uploads (The User).
- Computer vision algorithm to analyze outfits we find on clothing brands’ advertisements, or datasets of outfits from popular clothing brands (The Stylist).
- Recommendation algorithm to output an outfit based on The Stylists’ findings and User’s preferences (The Recommender).

#### The User
- Details to go here

#### The Stylist
- Details to go here

#### The Recommender
- Details to go here


For example:
The user would take a picture of black jeans and we would recommend other articles of clothing (such as a blue shirt, black shoes) found in stores based on the picture. 
The recommendation would further be based on fit, color, and user preference. 
The user then has the option to buy the recommended articles of clothing within the app. 

#### Application Flow

#### Deployment
We are planning on developing a web/mobile application for the user to interact with to use the recommendation service.
