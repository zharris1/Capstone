    The Data Collector module:

    Introductory Module.

    Collects data from our four sources and stores in buckets for later use. 
    Performs basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), so data is in base form for use in other modules.

    SourceOne.py: A picture of the User's article of clothing. 
    SourceTwo.py: Public clothing datasets to recognize individual articles of clothing.
    SourceThree.py: Webscraped images of complete outfits from popular clothing brand advertisements.
    SourceFour.py: User's Preferences such as size, fit, color, inseam, etc...

    Returns: Transformed data in base form for later use in other modules for each .py file.
