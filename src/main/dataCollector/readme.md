    The Data Collector module:

    Introductory Module.

    Collects data from our four sources and stores in buckets for later use. 
    Performs basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), so data is in base form for use in other modules.

    SourceOne.py: A picture of the User's article of clothing (only a single photo). Used only for validation once models are trained
    SourceTwo.py: Fashion MNIST
    SourceThree.py: H&M Dataset
    SourceFour.py: Clothing sizes, lengths, and color for each article of clothing (add style of clothing in the future)

    Returns: Transformed data in base form for later use in other modules for each .py file.
